# Kustomize

This demo will create a simple nginx installation with an init container. 

## Launching the base

```
kubectl apply -k base
```

## Launching test stage

This includes fewer replicas and a common name prefix "test-"

```
kubectl apply -k overlays/test
```

## Launching test stage

This will have more (7) replicas and will change the content generated by the init container to contain some production content.

```
kubectl apply -k overlays/production
```
